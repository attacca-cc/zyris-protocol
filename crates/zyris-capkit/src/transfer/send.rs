//! The sending side: what an agent calls to put a file on another node of the same account.
//!
//! Everything else under [`super`] is the receiving side. This module is the half that says
//! "send", and it is the only place in the crate that talks to the rendezvous
//! (`zyris-attacca`) or to the peer transport (`zyris-p2p`).
//!
//! # What guards what
//!
//! | Guard | Where | What it stops |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | The read jail | [`LocalFileTransfer::resolve_source`] | Sending a file that is not under the node's root |
//! | The answer check | [`LocalFileTransfer::look_up_peer`] | Sending to a machine the caller did not name |
//! | The pin | [`LocalFileTransfer::authorize_peer`] | Sending to a peer whose key is not the one a person confirmed |
//!
//! # Why the peer link is behind a trait
//!
//! [`PeerLink`] exists so the three guards above can be exercised end to end — through the real
//! [`super::peer::LocalPeerTransfer`], the real `push_offer`/`pull` exchange, onto a real file —
//! with no socket in it. [`IrohPeerLink`] is the production implementation and the only part of
//! this module that touches QUIC. That split is the same one the crates themselves already draw:
//! `zyris-capkit` implements capabilities, `zyris-p2p` carries them.
