//! Node-to-node file transfer, wired up.
//!
//! Everything this uses already existed; what was missing was anything calling it. Three things
//! have to happen, and only the first is obvious:
//!
//! 1. announce `file_transfer`, so an agent has a tool to call;
//! 2. **publish this node's endpoint**, or a peer looking us up finds nothing — until this,
//!    `AttaccaApi::peer_publish` had no caller anywhere outside a test, which meant `peer_lookup`
//!    had nothing to answer with and no transfer could have started;
//! 3. accept incoming connections, or transfers only ever go one way.
//!
//! Two and three need the connection to Attacca, which does not exist when a node builds the
//! capabilities it announces — hence `LocalFileTransfer::pending` and `set_api`, and hence the
//! on-connect hook here.
