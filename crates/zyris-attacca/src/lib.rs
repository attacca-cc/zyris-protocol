//! `attacca_api` — the capability the server side of the connection announces.
//!
//! Every other capability in this workspace is something a *node* offers. This one runs the other
//! way: [Attacca](https://attacca.cc) reserves the name `attacca_api`, rejects it from any node
//! that tries to announce it, and announces it itself right after the handshake. A node picks the
//! client up on connect and drives agents, projects and sessions over the same websocket it serves
//! its own tools on.
//!
//! It sits in its own crate rather than in `zyris-caps` because `zyris-caps` is the catalogue of
//! things a node implements, and this is the one surface a node only ever calls.
//!
//! Tools are added within version 1 rather than by bumping it: additive tool changes inside a
//! version are permitted, and consumers discover tools by descriptor. An older node keeps working
//! because it never asks for the new ones; a newer node against an older deployment finds the tool
//! absent from the announcement and gets `capability_not_announced` if it calls anyway.
//!
//! A node consumes it this way, in two lines of imports. Depending on the crate is still a
//! convenience rather than a requirement: matching is by `(name, version)` and the announced tool
//! list is never compared, so a node may instead declare just the slice it calls with its own
//! `#[zyris::capability]` trait — which is what consuming any capability nobody has published a
//! crate for looks like.
