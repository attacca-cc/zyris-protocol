//! Wire types and the polling state machine for the OAuth 2.0 Device Authorization Grant
//! (RFC 8628), as a node speaks it.
//!
//! **This module is always compiled and performs no IO.** That is deliberate: the retry semantics
//! below — `slow_down` widening the interval, `authorization_pending` not being an error,
//! `expired_token` meaning "start over" rather than "give up" — are exactly the logic that gets
//! copy-pasted wrong once and stays wrong. Keeping them pure means they can be unit-tested with no
//! server, no network, and no feature flag, which is the only way anyone will actually verify them.
//! It also lets a node with its own HTTP client use these types without taking `reqwest`.
