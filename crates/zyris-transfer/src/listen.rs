//! Taking incoming peer connections. **Not from anyone who asks.**
//!
//! An arriving connection is identified by one thing only: the `EndpointId` QUIC authenticated it
//! against. To turn that into "one of my own machines" this asks the rendezvous for the account's
//! node list and looks the id up in it. Anything not on that list is closed without a zyris
//! handshake ever happening.
//!
//! # Why nothing is pinned here
//!
//! The sending side pins, because it has something worth keying a pin on: the name the *caller*
//! typed, which attacca has no channel to reassign. This side has no such string. It knows an
//! `EndpointId` and whatever name the rendezvous attaches to it — and `ZPeerEntry::slug`'s own doc
//! is explicit that the slug is not a trust anchor: it is derived from a node `name` whose default
//! is the enrolling device's unverified self-report, it is neither unique nor stable, and freeing a
//! revoked node's slug so a *different* node can take it is deliberate, tested behaviour.
//!
//! So a pin written here would be keyed on a string the server chooses. That is the exact shape
//! `zyris_p2p::tofu`'s module doc calls out: a substituted peer arrives under a name nothing is
//! pinned under, passes, and gets pinned — every time, leaving no mark. Asking a person first does
//! not fix it, because the person would be confirming a name attacca picked.
//!
//! What this side does instead is **check and never write**. A slug the user has already pinned by
//! sending to it refuses a changed key, which is the protection that was ever real. A slug nobody
//! has pinned is let through and stays unpinned, so the ledger only ever holds names a person
//! actually said. The cost is that a peer we only receive from is never pinned; the alternative was
//! pinning it under a name that could not carry the weight.
//!
//! # Two things that would otherwise stall or amplify
//!
//! The accept loop never waits on a peer. `accept_next` returns as soon as there is a connection to
//! work with, and the handshake — which a peer can simply decline to finish — runs under a deadline
//! inside the spawned task. Waiting here would let one silent peer hold the whole listener shut.
//!
//! The node list is cached, and a lookup miss does **not** get to force a refresh: an unknown peer
//! that could make us re-query on every connection would be an amplifier pointed at the rendezvous
//! by anyone who can open a socket. Refreshes are rate-limited independently of what asks for them.
