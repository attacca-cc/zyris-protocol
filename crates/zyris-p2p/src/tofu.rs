//! Pin a peer's `EndpointId` to **the first one we saw** (Trust On First Use).
//!
//! attacca issues node credentials and runs the rendezvous, so a "fake B" introduced to A
//! cannot be ruled out by cryptography alone. Pinning turns that into an attack that works
//! **once, never twice, and leaves a mark** — but only if the ledger is keyed on something
//! attacca itself cannot re-mint.
//!
//! **`TofuStore::authorize` is the entry point.** `check` and `pin_preapproved` are the
//! primitives it is built from — a read-only lookup and a write that never asks anyone — kept
//! `pub` because a handful of callers legitimately need one without the other (see
//! `pin_preapproved`'s own doc for exactly which). Reaching for them together instead of
//! `authorize` silently rebuilds the pre-2.7 flow this module used to have, where an unknown
//! peer got pinned on its first successful connection with no human ever asked. Nothing in this
//! module can stop that at compile time — `check` then `pin_preapproved` typechecks fine — so
//! the defense here is naming: `pin_preapproved` says out loud what the caller is asserting.
//!
//! **The rule for the key `check`/`pin_preapproved`/`authorize` all take (`peer_slug`): it
//! must be a name the *user* chose, and one that no server can re-issue.** That is the actual
//! property — not a list of specific fields to avoid, because any string attacca hands us,
//! however it is spelled, fails it the same way. Two are worth naming anyway, since they are
//! the ones most likely to end up
//! here by a well-meaning mistake: attacca's own `node_id` (see `ConnectionInfo` in
//! `zyris-core/src/connection.rs`), and `TokenResponse.node_name`
//! (`zyris-core/src/enroll/protocol.rs`), which gets persisted as `AccountCredential.node_name`
//! (`zyris-core/src/account.rs`) and looks
//! enough like a user-facing label to be mistaken for one. It is not: attacca supplies it,
//! unverified, exactly like `node_id`, and reports it fresh for every node — nothing stops a
//! fake B from arriving with a *new* `node_id` and the *same* `node_name` as the real one, or a
//! `node_name` chosen to look however it likes. Whichever server-issued string ends up in this
//! slot, the fake arrives as an unknown peer, passes `check` (nothing is pinned under an
//! identifier nobody has seen before), and gets pinned — every time, with no mark left
//! anywhere. Keying on a name the user picked, that attacca has no channel to silently
//! reassign, is what actually makes the substitution visible: attacca can mint or report as
//! many identifiers as it wants, but it cannot make a second one answer to the slug the user
//! already pinned without `check` catching the mismatch.
//!
//! **There is no automatic way out.** A human has to edit the file. Accepting a changed key
//! quietly would make the pin worth nothing.
//!
//! Two writers can be two `tokio::task`s in this process or two entirely separate
//! processes sharing the same path — both are possible once a node runs more than one
//! connection. An in-process `tokio::sync::Mutex` only ever sees the first kind, so
//! `pin_preapproved` also takes a `<ledger>.lock` file: the one thing every writer, in any
//! process, actually shares.
//!
//! **This defends against a remote peer substituting itself, not against local tampering.**
//! `{"peers":{}}` is a perfectly valid, empty ledger; writing it over the real one erases
//! every pin and no shape check can tell the difference from a node that has genuinely never
//! connected to anyone. Anyone who can write this file can just as easily delete it, or
//! replace the node's own key outright (see `key.rs`) — local write access to our config
//! directory is game over by construction, for this store and for the node's identity both.
//! That is not a gap in this design; it is outside what a TOFU pin can ever claim to cover.
