#![cfg(windows)]

//! The Windows half of `terminal`, which until now nothing ran.
//!
//! CI is `ubuntu-latest`, so every claim this crate makes about Windows has been carried by its
//! comments alone. One of those claims is load-bearing: `Terminal::exec`'s own doc tells a caller
//! that the way to run a PowerShell script without fighting quoting is
//!
//! ```text
//! argv: ["powershell.exe", "-NoProfile", "-NonInteractive", "-Command", "-"], stdin: <script>
//! ```
//!
//! and says in as many words that this needs "no escaping, no base64 encoding". That sentence is
//! the tool description an agent reads. If it is wrong, the agent is being told to do something
//! that does not work — which is the shape of the report these tests exist to settle: agents
//! reaching for `-EncodedCommand` because quoting bit them.
//!
//! So each test here asserts a promise the documentation already makes. A failure is not a Windows
//! quirk to work around; it is the doc being wrong, and the fix belongs in the doc and in whatever
//! the doc should have said instead.

/// The documented pattern, doing the one thing it is documented for: carrying a script that is
/// full of the characters a command line would mangle.
///
/// Both quote kinds, a `$`, a backtick and a `%` — every one of them a character that means
/// something to some layer between here and the interpreter.
///
/// **The backtick is doubled on purpose, and the first version of this test got it wrong.** Inside
/// a PowerShell double-quoted string the backtick is *PowerShell's* escape character, so a lone
/// `` ` `` before a `b` is the escape for backspace and the script asked for one. It duly arrived:
/// the assertion failed with `\u{8}acktick`, which is not a transport mangling anything — it is
/// the interpreter doing exactly what its own quoting rules say. Doubling it is how PowerShell
/// spells a literal backtick, and that is what this asserts survives.
///
/// The distinction is the whole point of the file. This suite exists to catch the transport
/// altering a script; a test that trips over the interpreter's own syntax reports a fault in the
/// wrong place, and would have had someone rewriting `Terminal::exec`'s documentation over a
/// mistake in the example.
