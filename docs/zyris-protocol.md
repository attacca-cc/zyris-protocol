# Zyris Protocol v1

Zyris is an expandable computer protocol. A **Zyris Node** is any machine that dials into a
server over a websocket, announces typed **capabilities** (named, versioned sets of tools),
and may simultaneously consume capabilities the peer announces.

The protocol is direction-symmetric: after the handshake, either peer may send requests,
open streams, and announce capabilities. "Node" and "server" below refer to the dialing and
accepting peers respectively; every rule applies to both directions unless stated.

[Attacca](https://attacca.cc) is the reference deployment and the origin of the protocol. It is
itself a Zyris Node: it is the sole announcer of the `attacca_api` capability, which lets nodes
drive agents, sessions, and live turn streams over the same connection. This document is the wire
reference; where it describes something a deployment chooses rather than something the wire
requires — credential formats, enrollment, cross-pod routing — it says so and uses Attacca as the
worked example.

## 0. Writing a node

`crates/zyris-hello` is a complete, runnable node in two short files — one capability with one
tool, plus the connect/reconnect loop and the consume side. Start there; this document is the
normative wire reference, not a tutorial. See `crates/zyris-hello/README.md` for how to run it
against a local server.

## 1. Transport and framing

One websocket per connection. Endpoint: `wss://<host>/zyris/v1/ws`. TLS is mandatory; the
URL path pins the protocol **major** version (a breaking envelope change becomes
`/zyris/v2/ws`).

Two frame classes ride the socket. Every websocket **binary** frame begins with a one-byte
kind tag:

| Tag    | Name        | Layout after the tag |
|--------|-------------|----------------------|
| `0x00` | CONTROL     | msgpack-encoded `Envelope` |
| `0x01` | STREAM_DATA | `stream_id: u32 BE`, `chunk_seq: u32 BE`, raw payload bytes |
| `0x02`–`0x0F` | reserved | receivers MUST close with `4408` on unknown tags |

Serialization modes:

- **msgpack** (default): CONTROL frames are binary tag `0x00`. Blob bytes never pass
  through msgpack.
- **json** (negotiated at handshake): CONTROL envelopes ride as websocket **text** frames
  (no tag byte — the websocket opcode discriminates); STREAM_DATA stays binary `0x01`.
  JSON mode exists for debuggability and browser-adjacent clients.

`chunk_seq` starts at 0 per stream and increments by 1 per chunk. On a direct hop TCP makes
it trivially contiguous; it exists so a relayed hop (§9) can detect loss: any gap MUST fail
the stream with `stream_lagged` — never deliver bytes past a gap.

Limits are server-declared in `hello_ack` (defaults): max CONTROL frame 8 MiB (headroom above
the 4 MiB inline-blob ceiling), max STREAM_DATA payload 256 KiB, `max_inflight_reqs` 64,
`initial_stream_credit` 256 KiB.
Violations are protocol errors: `payload_too_large` on the offending request, or connection
close `4409` for credit violations.

## 2. Envelope

A single tagged union, tag field `t`. Shown as JSON; msgpack on the wire by default.

```jsonc
{ "t": "req",  "id": 17, "method": "terminal.exec", "params": { }, "stream": { "id": 42 } }
{ "t": "res",  "id": 17, "result": { } }
{ "t": "err",  "id": 17, "error": { "code": "invalid_params", "message": "…", "retriable": false, "data": null } }
{ "t": "note", "method": "webrtc.signal", "params": { } }
{ "t": "prog", "id": 17, "payload": { } }
{ "t": "cancel", "id": 17 }
{ "t": "s_credit", "stream": 42, "bytes": 262144 }
{ "t": "s_end",    "stream": 42, "trailer": { "sha256": "…" } }
{ "t": "s_err",    "stream": 42, "error": { "code": "io_error", "message": "…", "retriable": true } }
{ "t": "s_cancel", "stream": 42 }
```

- `method` is `{capability}.{tool}` for capability tools, or a `zyris.*` / `webrtc.*`
  protocol method (§5, §8).
- `id` is a monotonically increasing `u64`, allocated by the sender; the two directions are
  independent id spaces. A `res`/`err`/`prog`/`cancel` always references the receiver's view
  of the originating `req`.
- `req.stream` is present iff the tool's declared transfer mechanism involves a stream; the
  request **sender** allocates the stream id (§4).
- `prog` frames are optional, per-tool-schema progress updates; zero or more precede the
  final `res`/`err`.
- `cancel` is best-effort and idempotent. The canceled request MUST still terminate with
  exactly one `res` or `err` (normally `err canceled`). `cancel` for an unknown or finished
  id is silently ignored.
- Exceeding `max_inflight_reqs` yields `err overloaded` (retriable).

### 2.1 Errors

`code` is a string; `retriable` is explicit per instance (a callee may mark a normally
retriable failure permanent). Registered protocol codes:

```
parse_error            unsupported_version    unauthorized         forbidden_scope
method_not_found       invalid_params         capability_not_announced
capability_rejected    capability_unavailable node_offline*        connection_lost*
stream_lagged*         credit_violation       payload_too_large    overloaded*
canceled               timeout*               internal
```

`*` = conventionally retriable. Capabilities define additional codes; they MUST NOT collide
with the registry above.

## 3. Connection lifecycle

```
CLOSED ──dial──▶ AUTHENTICATING ──upgrade ok──▶ HELLO ──hello/hello_ack──▶ READY
   ▲                   │ 4401                      │ unsupported_version → CLOSED (4400)
   │                   ▼                           │
   └────────────── CLOSED ◀── CLOSING ◀── zyris.closing / ws close / heartbeat timeout
        reconnect w/ resume_token within grace ⇒ presence continuity (§3.4)
```

### 3.1 Auth

The dialer sends `Authorization: Bearer <credential>` on the upgrade request. Auth failure closes
the socket with websocket code `4401` before any Zyris frame. What a valid credential *looks like*
is the deployment's choice; the wire only requires that it ride in that header.

The socket authenticates once at the upgrade and nothing re-checks it, so a deployment that supports
revocation or credential expiry needs an in-band way to act on it. The recommended shape, and
Attacca's: the periodic heartbeat also reports whether the node was revoked and when its newest
credential expires, and the peer holding the socket closes it on either. Without that, revocation
takes effect only on whichever replica happens to see the revoke call.

Attacca's scheme, as the worked example: two credential kinds, dispatched **by prefix** before any
database work — a static `znt_` node token, or a short-lived `zna_` access token from device
enrollment (§7). Both are hashed at rest and carry the node's scopes. `znr_` refresh tokens and
`zdc_` device codes are valid credentials for *other* endpoints and are refused here explicitly,
never by happening not to hash to anything.

### 3.2 Handshake

The first frame in each direction is the handshake, **always msgpack** regardless of the
outcome of negotiation.

```jsonc
// dialer → acceptor
{ "t": "hello",
  "protocol": { "major": 1, "minors_supported": [0] },
  "serialization": ["msgpack", "json"],
  "agent": "zyris-node/0.1.0 (linux; x86_64)",
  "features": ["cancel", "attachments", "video-webrtc", "video-mjpeg"],
  "resume": { "conn_id": "…", "resume_token": "…" } }        // optional

// acceptor → dialer
{ "t": "hello_ack",
  "protocol": { "major": 1, "minor": 0 },
  "serialization": "msgpack",
  "conn_id": "…", "resume_token": "…",
  "node_id": "…",
  "heartbeat": { "interval_s": 20, "timeout_s": 45 },
  "limits": { "max_control_frame": 1048576, "max_chunk": 262144,
              "max_inflight_reqs": 64, "initial_stream_credit": 262144 },
  "resumed": false,
  "features": ["cancel", "attachments"] }
```

Version mismatch ⇒ `err unsupported_version` then websocket close `4400`. A peer MUST NOT
send frames gated behind a feature the other side did not advertise. `features` is absent
on an acceptor that predates the field, which reads as advertising nothing — the safe
answer, since a feature is usable only when it appears in *both* lists.

### 3.3 Heartbeat and close

Websocket ping/pong is the liveness primitive: the acceptor pings every `interval_s`;
either side closes after `timeout_s` of silence. Graceful close: send
`note zyris.closing { reason }`, stop issuing new requests, finish or cancel in-flight
work, then websocket close `1000`. A server shutting down for a rolling restart sends
`reason: "server_restart"` so nodes reconnect immediately instead of backing off.

### 3.4 Reconnect is deliberately lossy

On disconnect, every in-flight request on both sides fails locally with `connection_lost`
(retriable) and every open stream is dead. Reconnecting with a valid `resume_token` within
the grace window (30 s) restores **identity continuity only**: the node is never marked
offline, and its capability announcement is assumed unchanged (`resumed: true`); otherwise
the node MUST re-announce.

Resume of interrupted work is an application concern by design: turn streams resume by
cursor, file transfers by byte offset, PTYs by re-open and redraw. Streaming tools MUST
document their resume story.

## 4. Streams

A stream is born from a request: the request sender allocates the id and declares it in
`req.stream.id`. Ids are `u32`, never reused within a connection; the dialer allocates odd
ids, the acceptor even ids.

Transfer mechanisms, declared per tool in the capability descriptor:

| `transfer`   | Behavior |
|--------------|----------|
| `unary`      | `req` → (`prog`)* → `res`/`err`. Datums inline or via a declared stream. |
| `uni_stream` | Caller declares the stream; the `res` arrives **immediately** carrying the typed stream head (metadata such as file stat or initial status); the **callee** then sends item chunks caller-ward until `s_end` (optional summary in `trailer`) or `s_err`. Failure to start yields a plain `err` and no chunks. |
| `bi_stream`  | Reserved in v1. Frames are defined (one id, direction implicit in sender) but implementations MUST reject tools declaring it. |
| `video`      | No websocket data frames; the request establishes a video session and WebRTC signaling follows (§8). |

Chunk payload semantics are defined per tool. Typed uni-streams encode exactly one item
per chunk in the connection's negotiated serialization (msgpack by default) — this is how
`attacca_api.turn_events` frames and `file_io.read_stream` byte chunks (a `bin`-encoded item)
travel. MJPEG fallback chunks are `[u64 BE timestamp_µs][one complete JPEG]`.

### 4.1 Flow control

Credit-based, mandatory, per stream. The receiver implicitly grants
`initial_stream_credit` bytes at stream birth and tops up with additive
`s_credit { stream, bytes }`. The byte-sender MUST NOT exceed outstanding credit; a
violation is a protocol bug: `s_err credit_violation` + connection close `4409`. CONTROL
frames are never subject to credit.

Rationale: one websocket multiplexes many streams — without credits a slow 2 GiB file sink
head-of-line-blocks PTY keystrokes and heartbeats; and the relayed hop (§9) has no
end-to-end TCP backpressure, so credits are the only bound on relay buffering.

### 4.2 Stream termination

- Clean end: byte-sender emits `s_end { stream, trailer? }` (trailer may carry `sha256`).
- Sender failure: `s_err`; receiver abort: `s_cancel` (sender stops, discards).
- Implicit close: the final `res`/`err` of the owning request closes any stream it
  declared (well-behaved senders still send `s_end` first; the implicit rule covers
  crashes).

```
DECLARED ──first chunk──▶ FLOWING ⇄ BLOCKED(credit=0)
    │                        │ s_err / s_cancel
    │ s_cancel               ▼
    ▼                      ENDING ──s_end──▶ CLOSED
  CLOSED ◀── owning req res/err or connection loss (forced)
```

## 5. Capabilities

A capability is a named, integer-versioned set of tools. Each tool declares a transfer
mechanism and schemars-generated JSON Schemas (request, response, optional stream item).

Announcement is a normal request, available to **either peer** after `hello_ack`:

```jsonc
{ "t": "req", "id": 1, "method": "zyris.announce", "params": {
  "capabilities": [
    { "name": "terminal", "version": 1,
      "tools": [
        { "name": "exec", "description": "Run a command to completion.",
          "transfer": "unary",
          "request_schema": { }, "response_schema": { } },
        { "name": "open", "description": "Open an interactive PTY.",
          "transfer": "uni_stream",
          "request_schema": { }, "response_schema": { }, "item_schema": { } } ] } ] } }

{ "t": "res", "id": 1, "result": {
  "accepted": ["terminal"],
  "rejected": [ { "name": "attacca_api", "reason": "reserved" } ] } }
```

- `zyris.announce` is **full-replacement and idempotent**: re-announcing without a
  previously announced capability revokes it; mid-session capability changes are just a new
  announce. Revocation fails in-flight calls on that capability with
  `capability_unavailable`.
- Calling a tool of a capability the peer has not announced ⇒ `capability_not_announced`.
- A deployment may **reserve** capability names to itself, rejecting them from nodes with
  `capability_rejected`, reason `reserved`. Attacca reserves exactly `attacca_api`: it rejects that
  name from any node and announces it itself immediately after `hello_ack`, filtered to the tools
  the node's scopes permit, with every `attacca_api.*` call scope-checked. That capability is
  declared in `crates/zyris-attacca` — the deployment's surface, not the wire's, and the one
  capability a node only ever calls, which is why it is its own crate and not part of `zyris-caps`.
- A node may announce two versions of the same capability simultaneously (two entries).
  Additive tool changes within a version are permitted; consumers discover tools by
  descriptor.

## 6. Datums and blobs

Three datum kinds cross the wire as values inside `params` / `result` / stream items:

```jsonc
{ "kind": "text",  "text": "…", "format": "markdown" }
{ "kind": "file",  "filename": "report.pdf", "description": "Q3 export",
  "media_type": "application/pdf", "blob": <blob> }
{ "kind": "image", "name": "screen.png", "description": "current display",
  "media_type": "image/png", "blob": <blob> }
```

A blob is either:

- **inline** — allowed only when ≤ 512 KiB: msgpack `bin` (base64 string under negotiated
  JSON — one reason msgpack is the default). The ceiling comes from the far end rather than the
  wire: a deployment that measures a result as JSON pays base64's four-for-three, so 512 KiB
  arrives as 699,052 bytes, and Attacca's `ZYRIS_MAX_RESULT_BYTES` defaults to 1,000,000, or
- **attachment** — metadata in place of bytes:
  `{ "attachment": { "stream": 42, "size": 48293812, "sha256": "…", "offset": 0 } }`,
  bytes following as STREAM_DATA chunks on the referenced stream, `s_end.trailer.sha256`
  for end-to-end integrity. Interrupted transfers resume by re-issuing the call with
  `offset`.

Attachments are **negotiated**: both peers must advertise the `attachments` feature in
`hello.features` / `hello_ack.features`. Against a peer that did not, blobs stay inline
whatever their size, per §3.2.

Where they are used, the conversion is automatic and by size. A responder detaches every
blob over 4 MiB as it writes the response: it allocates a stream from its own parity
space (§4 — the byte sender allocates, so no `req.stream.id` is involved), writes the
reference in place of the bytes, sends the `res`, and then pushes the bytes as
STREAM_DATA chunks of at most `max_chunk`, paced by the receiver's credit. `s_end` carries
the digest, which the reference also names, so a receiver can check length and content
without having trusted either end alone.

The receiver opens the stream when it decodes the payload, not when its caller gets
around to looking — chunks are already in flight by then. An announced attachment nobody
claims within two minutes is cancelled, because an unclaimed stream otherwise holds its
sender at the credit ceiling for the life of the connection.

Implementation status: inline blobs, chunked uni-streams (which cover bulk file transfer
via `file_io.read_stream`/`write_at`), and attachments in responses. Attachments in *request
params* — a large datum travelling caller-ward, as `file_io.write` would want — are the
same mechanism mirrored and are not implemented yet.

## 7. Node identity, enrollment, presence

Enrollment is out-of-band: it happens over HTTP before the websocket exists, so none of it is on the
Zyris wire. It is documented here because `zyris` implements this half of it too, and because a node
author has to choose a credential source before anything else works.

**The library holds no credential of its own and picks no path to keep one at.** Every step hands its
result back as a value: `enroll()` returns an `Enrollment` whose `code()` is a `Code` to display,
`Enrollment::wait` returns an `AccountCredential`, and `Account::register_node` returns a `NodeToken`.
Storing them — a file, a keychain, a Kubernetes Secret, a database row — is the caller's, and so is
whether a code becomes a printed block, a window in a TUI, or a line in a journal.

- **Enrollment (device grant, default)**: the node starts unconfigured and runs RFC 8628. It
  `POST`s `/zyris/v1/device/authorize`, prints an 8-character base-20 code, and polls
  `/zyris/v1/device/token`. The user types that code into the deployment's web UI on whatever device
  has a browser, reviews what the node is asking for, and authorizes; the node's next poll receives
  an access token and a refresh token, which it stores at `0600` and rotates itself.
  `verification_uri_complete` is always null; the `verification_uri` points at the code-entry
  screen, so the user has no button to hunt for while a code expires. Daemon config is
  `{ server_url }`, and even that is optional: `zyris::DEFAULT_SERVER_URL` is
  `wss://attacca.cc/api/zyris/v1/ws`, and the HTTP base for the device endpoints is derived from it
  by truncating at `/zyris/`, so a node cannot enroll against one deployment while connecting to
  another.
- **Where the bearer comes from**: `Node::connect(url, token)` and `Node::dial(url, token)` take any
  bearer string, so a node provisioned with a `znt_` out of a secret manager never touches the
  enrollment code at all. A node that enrolled instead mints its bearer from what enrollment issued:
  `Account::restore(server_url, credential)` picks the pair back up, and `Account::register_node`
  returns a `NodeToken` to dial with. `Account` is behind the `enroll` feature, which is not on by
  default — the static-token path costs nothing for the device grant it never runs.
- **Rotation**: only the account credential rotates; a `znt_` node token is static and is never
  handed back. `Account` refreshes the pair on its own schedule (at 80% of the access token's
  lifetime, not at expiry) and hands each new pair to the async `on_rotate` hook the caller
  installed. **The hook has to succeed before the library adopts the new pair.** A refresh token is
  single-use: if a process began presenting a pair that never reached the caller's storage, its next
  start would present the spent one, and Attacca reads a replay past its 30-second grace as a leaked
  chain and revokes every node under that credential. Rotating early is what makes waiting for the
  hook safe — there are roughly twelve minutes of slack in which it can fail without stopping a dial,
  and a failure inside that window is logged and the credential still held is carried on with.
- **Staying connected**: `Node::connect` returns a `Link` that owns the dial-and-reconnect loop —
  backoff with jitter, reset after a healthy connection — and returns as soon as the first dial has
  settled. A refusal no retry can fix (`Revoked`, `Unauthorized`, `VersionMismatch`) is that call's
  error; anything else is the link's problem and it goes on trying. `Link::wait_closed` resolves when
  the link is finished and `Link::disconnect` ends it, giving the closing frame time to land. There
  is no signal handler and no exit code: when the process stops is the program's decision.
- **Enrollment (static token)**: the user creates a node in the web UI and the server mints a
  one-time-displayed token (prefix retained for display, hash stored, scopes attached). Daemon
  config is `{ server_url, node_token }`. Retained for provisioning with no human in the loop —
  image-baked nodes, CI, and shared service accounts, where a credential file cannot be protected
  from anyone able to `sudo -u` that account.
- **Scopes**: a node's grant, decided at enrollment and enforced by the server on every call into a
  reserved capability. The vocabulary is the deployment's; Attacca reuses its API-scope names. A
  node that only *serves* capabilities needs no scopes at all.
- **Node naming**: a node proposes a name at enrollment — by default its hostname, via
  `zyris::machine_name()` — and the approving user may change it. After enrollment the name is
  local only: renaming in the node's environment does not rename an existing node.
- **Presence**: online on READY; on disconnect a resume grace (30 s in Attacca) runs before offline.
  A periodic sweep marks nodes offline whose last heartbeat exceeds 2× the heartbeat interval, as a
  backstop against a server replica dying with the socket open.

The server-side registry — what a deployment stores per node, how ownership is fenced, how presence
fans out to a UI — is deployment-internal. See `docs/zyris-protocol.md` in the
[Attacca repo](https://github.com/attacca-cc/attacca) for how the reference deployment does it.

## 8. Video

Media must not traverse Attacca server pods. A `video` tool call establishes a session;
WebRTC signaling rides in-band as symmetric notes; media flows peer-to-peer (or via TURN).

1. `req { method: "screen.live", params: { source, max_height } }` →
   `res { video_session_id, codecs: ["h264/baseline", "vp8"], ice_servers: [ ] }`.
   `codecs` is a capability list; the final choice happens in SDP.
2. Signaling, correlated by `video_session_id`:
   `note webrtc.signal { video_session_id, signal: { type: "offer"|"answer", sdp } }` and
   trickle ICE `signal: { type: "ice", candidate, mid }`.
3. Teardown: `note webrtc.close { video_session_id }` from either side.
4. Fallback (feature `video-mjpeg`): a `uni_stream` tool streaming one timestamped JPEG per
   chunk — a degraded path, labeled as such in the announcement.

Open prerequisite: cross-NAT video requires TURN infrastructure; until Attacca operates
TURN, WebRTC works only where direct/STUN paths exist.

## 9. Relayed hops

A multi-replica server terminates a node's websocket on exactly one replica (the **owning**
replica) while calls may originate on any of them, so the call has to cross a hop the protocol
does not define. How that hop is carried is the deployment's business; what the protocol requires
of it is not:

- **Ownership must be fenced.** A replica that believes it owns a connection it has lost will
  answer for a node it cannot reach. Carry a per-connection epoch on every relayed message and drop
  traffic fenced by a newer one.
- **Ordering is per direction, per call.** Control and data interleave meaningfully — a credit grant
  that overtakes the chunk it was issued for is a bug — so a relay must preserve the order of
  everything it carries in one direction of one call.
- **Loss must surface, not silently truncate.** `chunk_seq` (§1) exists for exactly this hop: an
  at-most-once transport can drop a chunk, and the receiver MUST fail the stream with
  `stream_lagged` rather than deliver bytes past the gap. Credits (§4.1) are the only bound on relay
  buffering, since there is no end-to-end TCP backpressure across the hop.
- **The 256 KiB chunk cap** keeps a relayed frame inside the message-size limit of most brokers.

A deployment with no relay routes node calls on the owning replica only; a call landing elsewhere
fails with `node_offline` (retriable). Attacca's implementation — NATS subjects, epoch fencing
against the node row — is documented in `docs/zyris-protocol.md` in the
[Attacca repo](https://github.com/attacca-cc/attacca).

## 10. Websocket close codes

| Code   | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `1000` | graceful close |
| `4400` | unsupported protocol version |
| `4401` | authentication failed |
| `4408` | unknown frame kind / malformed frame |
| `4409` | flow-control violation |
